    Apply the given template
    Able to print out the airport_sample
    create:
        folder: catch tests
        airport_sample.dat

    readFromFile can read airport and route
    Able to print the sample data in main function with split
    add documentations for functions
    create:
        route.dat route_sample.dat
    TODO:
        discuss how to implement with adjacent list
        

2020/11/23
    Able to find the matched airport on the world map
    implement a Hashtable
    create:
        graph.cpp graph.hpp
    TODO: 
        implement the graph using desired algorithm
        draw the airline on the map using HSLA

2020/11/24
    PROBLEMs:
        The edge class seems not working. How to draw the airline?
        How to adjust changes in Makefile? For example, which class need to create an object file
        Confuse about the arguments in drawAirline. 
        
        How to implement shortest path?
        or change shortest path to spanning tree.
        how to deal with route.dat

        we have "unknown type name" error

2020/11/26
    We solve the unknown typename problem due to crossing-reference
    We implement the graph using the Adjlist and BFS. 
    We deleted a unsued class: listnode

2020/11/27

    !!!after "make finalproj" and "./fianlproj" we met a "free() invalid pointer" error and then core dumped
    I suspect it is a memory leak problem because we have not written any destructor yet.
    In our main function, I try to draw a diagnoal white line. 
    Once it is solved, we can keep on doing shortest path.
    But how to implement shortest path?

    leak?
    imporve drawAirline algorithm

2020/11/29
    Able to draw an airline on the map (world_map.png) given a source airport and destination airport. 
    Remaining problem: we cannot draw a opened line through the Paciffic Ocean. 


2020/11/30
    Write a function to color the airport but not tested yet
    We can find the number of incid_edges of the vertex which has the maximum incid_edges.
    This is used to change the HSLAPixel of the vertex color gradiently by the weight of the incident edges.
    Debugged the build_hash() and build().
    It turns out that our edge class has changed 
    but our algorithm has not adapt the changes, which lead to a segfault.
    Debugging the BFS() and BFS(Vertex).

    TODO: 
        Finsh debugging the BFS and we should output something.
        Test the drawAirport.
        

2020/12/1
    Wrote a function to pick the luminance for the airport points.
    Read the data file in to our data structure and tested
    Test BFS

    TODO:
        Further debugging the data sturcture
        Prepare for the mid-project checking
